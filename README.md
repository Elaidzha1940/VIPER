VIPER - Clean Swift Architecture.
=================================

VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) is a modular and scalable architecture pattern for iOS applications. 
It divides the app into modules, each with its specific role:

------

- View: Displays the user interface and reacts to user actions. It doesn't contain business logic but forwards user actions to the presenter.

- Interactor: Contains the app's business logic. It handles requests from the presenter, performs necessary operations, and returns results.

- Presenter: Responsible for presenting data received from the interactor on the screen. It transforms data into a format understandable for display.

- Entity: Represents data objects in the application. It can be a struct, class, or protocol describing data attributes.

- Router: Handles navigation between modules and screen transitions. Typically, the presenter instructs the router on which screens to display.

Setup:
------

- Project Setup: Establishing the project structure, configuring dependencies, and setting up core components.

- First Module: Implementing each VIPER component for the initial app screen, including their interactions.

- Module Communication: Implementing mechanisms for communication between different modules, such as data processing and screen transitions.

- Second Module: Repeating the module creation process for the second app screen.

- Conclusion: An overview of the entire process of building a modular architecture using VIPER and its advantages for iOS app development.
